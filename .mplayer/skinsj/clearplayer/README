ClearPlayer: a Clearlooks skin for MPlayer

Created by mxt (http://rethor.no-ip.org/mxt) for the GTK engine ClearLooks
version 0.6.2.

Fonts and general inspiration are from the excellent work by Nikola Pizurica
(pizurica@neobee.net).

ClearLooks is a masterpiece by Richard Stellingwerff and Daniel Borgmann.

Jakub 'jimmac' Steiner is the creator of the wonderful gnome icons.
